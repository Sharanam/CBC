# City Bus Live Status
 - Mini Project for 3rd semester of MCA
 - Tech Stack: MERN
 - Idea: 
   - inspired from whereismytrain android application
   - but for the city bus

## Code
 - You can find the latest code into the branch, named **`post-internals`**, because that's where I was developing the stuff, after finishing my internal evaluation.
   
## Installation
 - go to cbcfront and install packages using npm. Followed by
 ```bash 
 npm start
 ```
 - go to cbcNode and do the same. Followed by
 ```bash
 npm run server
 ```
 - From root, you can start both using
 ```bash 
 npm start
 ```

## Developers Note:
- this project has some issues, and so many things need to be re-visited.
